ROCKSTAR Lyrics
Woo, woo
I pull up like
Let's go
With the pistol on my hip like I'm a cop (Yeah, yeah, yeah)
Have you ever met a real nigga rockstar? (Yeah)
This ain't no guitar, bitch, this a Glock (Woo)
My Glock told me to promise you gon' squeeze me (Woo)
You better let me go the day you need me (Woo)
Soon as you up me on that nigga, get to bustin' (Woo)
And if I ain't enough, go get the chop
It's safe to say I earned it, ain't a nigga gave me nothin' (Yeah, yeah, yeah)
I'm ready to hop out on a nigga, get to bustin'
Know you heard me say, "You play, you lay," don't make me push the button
Full of pain, dropped enough tears to fill up a fuckin' bucket
Goin' for buckets, I bought a chopper
I got a big drum, it hold a hundred, ain't goin' for nothin'
I'm ready to air it out on all these niggas, I can see 'em runnin'
Just talked to my mama, she hit me on FaceTime just to check up on me and my brother
I'm really the baby, she know that her youngest son was always guaranteed to get the money (Okay, let's go)
She know that her baby boy was always guaranteed to get the loot
She know what I do, she know 'fore I run from a nigga, I'ma pull it out and shoot (Boom)
PTSD, I'm always waking up in cold sweats like I got the flu
My daughter a G, she saw me kill a nigga in front of her before the age of two
And I'll kill another nigga too
'Fore I let another nigga do somethin' to you
Long as you know that, don't let nobody tell you different
Daddy love you (Yeah, yeah)
Let's go
Brand new Lamborghini, fuck a cop car
With the pistol on my hip like I'm a cop (Yeah, yeah, yeah)
Have you ever met a real nigga rockstar? (Yeah)
This ain't no guitar, bitch, this a Glock (Woo)
My Glock told me to promise you gon' squeeze me (Woo)
You better let me go the day you need me (Woo)
Soon as you up me on that nigga, get to bustin' (Woo, yeah)
And if I ain't enough, go get the chop (Yeah, yeah)
Keep a Glocky when I ride in the Suburban
'Cause the codeine had a young nigga swervin'
I got the mop, watch me wash 'em like detergent
And I'm ballin', that's why it's diamonds on my jersey
Slide on opps' side and flip the block back, yeah, yeah
My junior popped him and left him lopsided, yeah, yeah
We spin his block, got the rebound, Dennis Rodman
Fool me one time, you can't cross me again
Twelve hundred horsepower, I get lost in the wind
If he talkin' on the yard, the pen' dogs'll take his chin
Maybach SUV for my refugees
Buy blocks in the hood, put money in the streets
I was solo when the opps caught me at the gas station
Had it on me, thirty thousand, thought it was my last day
But they ain't even want no smoke
If I had to choose it, murder what she wrote
Let's go
Brand new Lamborghini, fuck a cop car
With the pistol on my hip like I'm a cop (Yeah, yeah, yeah)
Have you ever met a real nigga rockstar? (Yeah)
This ain't no guitar, bitch, this a Glock (Woo)
My Glock told me to promise you gon' squeeze me (Woo)
You better let me go the day you need me (Woo)
Soon as you up me on that nigga, get to bustin' (Woo)
And if I ain't enough, go get the chop171Embed

But fuck it, I'm obviously winnin'
Don't make me go hit the bank and take out a hundred
To show you our pockets are different (Ha)
I'm out with your bitch and I only want knowledge
She got a lil' mileage, I'm chillin' (Uh)
You disrespect me and I'll beat your ass up
All in front of your partners and children (Ahh, ahh)
I'm the type to let a nigga think that I'm broke
Until I pop out with a million (I pop)
Take 20K and put that on your head
And make one of your partners come kill you (Yeah)
Say he fuckin' with me then he gotta grow up
'Cause this nigga gotta be kiddin' (Kiddin')
This shit, it can't fit in my pocket
I got it, like I hit the lottery, nigga (Hot, hot, hot)
Opp, I'll slap the shit out a nigga
No talkin', I don't like to argue with niggas (I don't)
Ain't gon' be no more laughin'
You see me whip out 'cause I'm gon' be done shot me a nigga (No cap)

You little niggas wanna be internet gangster
Man, tell all these little niggas stop that (Ha)
Been done burnt me a nigga in front of the store
Where your mammy and grandmama shop at (Bitch)
Hopped out on a whole other wave from these niggas
Let's see one of you little niggas top that
I will turn a nigga into a convertible
Push me a lil' nigga top back (Vroom)
Her boyfriend be hatin' and callin' her groupie
Just 'cause she like all my music (Ha)
She'll send me a text and then delete the message
He tryna find out, it's confusin'
I don't know what these niggas is thinkin' about
Use the brain in your head 'fore you lose it (Bitch)
I'll pull up after school and I'll teach her some shit
Tell your bro I'm a motherfuckin' tutor
'Member I used to cheat off a pretty bitch test
All the teachers, they thought I was stupid (Uh huh)

Baby Lyrics
Wheezy outta here
Yeah, rest in peace to Bankroll‚ show 'em how to do it
Baby goin' crazy‚ he been gettin' straight to it
I done caught so many flights I end up fuckin' all the stewardesses
Catch me in Atlanta‚ no security with my jewelry
Found I was rich, my baby mama talkin' suin' me
'Nother bitch tellin' lies on the pussy like she screwin' me
Catch him down bad, that's his ass‚ nigga, you or me
SI diamonds on the chain, he ain't foolin' me
We was skippin' school on the train‚ duckin' truancy
My main partner turned into a rat, he talkin' 'bout robbin' me
I pray the judge give that boy a bond so I can pop him
We was in the hood, sellin' bags, shootin' choppers
Fucked around and tried to go and lease a helicopter
Baby really a problem, somebody gotta stop him
And the haters watchin' too hard, I think they got binoculars
Every nigga with me on go, it ain't no stoppin' us
Niggas actin' like they got the bag, I'm tryna stop it up
Do this for the bros down the road, gotta lock it up
All you gotta do is say it's smoke, then we're poppin' up
Baby got the streets on hold, he ain't drop yet
I've been goin' hard, it's gon' be hard for you to top that
I make it look easy, but this shit really a process
I'm really a millionaire, still in the projects
Baby puttin' on for the city
Baby, he the realest, Baby prolly got a couple million
Baby hang with four or five killers
Baby got children, Baby prolly still drug dealin
Baby ain't a trapper, he a rapper
Baby makin' classics, Baby in the hood gettin' active
Baby keep it real with his people
Baby like a preacher, Baby prolly still sell reefer
Huh? Baby prolly still got them 'bows
I tell my bitch I'm faithful, but I still got the hoes
Baby gettin' jiggy, on stage with the Glizzy
Baby CEO, he shake the game like he Diddy
You would think it's Mardi Gras, I got these bitches showin' titties
And I ain't throwin' beads, I pull them bitches' weaves
I'm stallin' bitches out, if I'm a dog, then she a flea
And when I fuck her doggystyle the only time I'm on my knee
I barely wanna hit her, got her beggin', "Baby, please"
I tell a bitch to shut up, you 'bout to fuck my nut up
The label's CEO keep beggin' me to keep the gun up
They know, you play with Baby, Baby beat him, cut up
Private plane, Wi-Fi, on the FaceTime with Johnny
I told him ice my wrist up, I like to hold my fist up
How that boy DaBaby in the air not gettin' his dick sucked?
Why he keep the fire and throw them fours in every picture?
'Cause nigga...
Baby puttin' on for the city
Baby, he the realest, Baby prolly got a couple million
Baby hang with four or five killers
Baby got children, Baby prolly still drug dealin
Baby ain't a trapper, he a rapper
Baby makin' classics, Baby in the hood gettin' active
Baby keep it real with his people
Baby like a preacher, Baby prolly still sell reefer26Embed

INTRO Lyrics
Thinkin' 'bout my grandmama and shit (Wait a minute, who are you?)
And I'm just somewhere fucked up thinkin' 'bout my father and shit
They found him dead a couple days before I started tour
Same day I flew back to the city from Miami
I was out there with the family
Just lookin' at my daughter
Thinkin' to myself like, "Damn, my baby look just like my daddy"
Same time I got the news, my shit went number one, that's fucked up
That shit there was confusin', a lil' bit, you know I flew in with the stick
Okay, like let me know what's up before I lose it in this bitch
And everybody tryna talk, I ain't tryna talk, I'm tryna click
I'm tryna send somebody wit' him
Somebody let me know what's happenin'
My last name K-I-R-K, Kirk
You know how I rock behind my daddy
You know I never gave a fuck about the world, just about my family
How the fuck I make it to the top same day I lost the nigga that had me?
How a nigga perform on BET and a year ago couldn't afford a sandwich?
I had to move in with TG when I went broke movin' out to Cali
What you know about smilin' every day for all your fans, actin' like you happy?
I spent a hundred thousand layin' my daddy to rest, but I ain't braggin'
I got some questions, I'm a die about respect if I don't get answers
My mama stood up in that chair, took it like a G when she had cancer
My brother be thinkin' that we don't love him and let him struggle like we ain't family
Like I won't give up all I got to see you happy, nigga
We shocked the world, everybody know what's happenin', nigga
I'm still Lil' Jon Jon, my song, it just went platinum, nigga
We on our own time, let's go move out to Cali, nigga
Put the kids in homeschool, let's go get us a mansion, nigga
Let's raise our kids right, let's watch the shit we teach 'em, nigga
Let's start a business for you so they can't say that you leechin', nigga
How I know I'm the chosen one, 'cause sometimes when I be speakin', nigga
Like on this song, I ain't rappin', I'm preachin', nigga
If I love you, then I need ya (Let's go)
I fuck with you like Martin fuck with Gina (Uh)
We family like we Venus and Serena (Hey)
Let's go get married like we Thankgod and Kenisha (Okay)
Don't give a fuck about the world, just 'bout my people (Facts)
I don't care what the fuck they told you, we ain't equal (Uh-uh)
Niggas ain't cut from the same cloth, these niggas see-through (Ayy)
And I be too busy doin' me to see what he do, nigga
Yeah, verse two, that lil' nigga from the other side (Uh-huh)
And I do it myself, whenever I ride, you know that my brothers ride (Okay)
And I still got a lotta shit on my mind that I can't undecide (Yeah, yeah)
Got me ready to slide, feelin' like Doughboy when his brother died (Boyz n the Hood)
You know how I step, you know how I rep, you know about Baby, nigga (You know about Baby)
You know how I'm comin' back for that cross if you ever play me, nigga (Get back)
You know how I got it up out the mud and turned it to gravy, nigga (Huh)
And hit the rap game like crack cocaine in the '80s, nigga
Fuck you niggas talkin' 'bout, bruh? Like.. (Oh my God, oh)
Look (Oh my God)
Look, man
Look (Oh my God)
Baby on Baby, now that's Baby on Baby

Panini (DaBaby Remix) Lyrics
D-D-Daytrip took it to ten (Hey)
Ayy, Panini, don't you be a meanie
I got fans finally, ain't you wantin' them to see me? I
I thought you want this for my life, for my life
Said you wanted to see me thrive, you lied
Just say to me what you want from me
Just say to me what you want from me
Baby, let's go, uh
Okay, this song right here remind me of my ex
Say I be declinin' all her calls and I don't respond to none of her texts
I be like, "Girl, hush your mouth, you know I ain't got time for nothin' but sex"
She know I injured my right hand so when I get behind I use my left
She watched that "Walker Texas Ranger," say I remind her of Nas X
I'm talkin' "Old Town Road," all my hoes down low
They like girls and I like girls, three at a time, sometimes four
And if my backend not all hundreds and ain't on time, then I don't go
I be like...
Say to me what you want from me
Just say to me what you want from me
What you want?
Ayy, Panini, don't you be a meanie
Thought you wanted me to go up
Why you tryna keep me teeny now?
Now they need me, number one on streaming
Oh yeah, you used to love me
So what happened, what's the meaning? I
I thought you want this for my life, for my life
Said you wanted to see me thrive, you lied
Now when it's all done, I get the upper hand
I need a big Benz, not another fan
But I still want you as a fan
I'ma need to sit down, don't mean to make demands
But I need you to...
Say to me what you want from me
Just say to me what you want from me
D-D-Daytrip took it to ten (Hey)13Embed

You look as good as Oprah's bank account
I just wanna take you out
You look as good as Oprah's bank account
I ain't mad at 'em, baby26Embed
Goin Baby Lyrics
Oh Lord, Jetson made another one
Hah
I'm goin’ baby on baby (Uh-huh)
That nigga a bitch, he think he a gangster
He probably still slangin' .380 (Ha)
Probably told you I'm lit, come get you a sniff

Pull up rockin' all white like I'm Gotti (Ha)
Put 'em up like a kite if he try me (Yuh)
Got 'em watchin', my life is excitin'
Just Facetimed my daughter, she laughin’ and smilin’ (Mwa)
Still got shit on my plate from November (Uh-huh)
A few open cases, they pendin' (Damn)
Fuck around, think I’m signed to Cash Money (I)
Pull up with a Drake and a sprinter (I)
Give a fuck how you think, how you feelin' (I)
Could show you how to make a few million (I'm)
So full of myself, say I'm cocky (Yup)
Ask the bitch if she copy, she copy (Okurr)
I go straight through the door with my Glocky (Uh, uh)
Niggas ain’t really poppin', we poppin' (Yeah)
Put the billion with baby, that business (Damn)

Your bitch is a dog, she got rabies (Brr, ruff)
I'm out doin' shows, state-to-state chasin' paper (Uh)

Now I'm out in LA like a motherfuckin' Laker
They left when I needed 'em, fucked up my feelings

Held it down on my own I proved everyone wrong every day (Ayy, ayy)

VIBEZ Lyrics
Let's go (Yeah, yeah, Neeko, you made that motherfuckin' beat? Ah, nah)

Go call my chauffeur, bitch, 'cause I don't like to drive
We in Suburbans back to back and we gon' fill 'em up with vibes (Let's go)
Fill 'em with vibes (Yeah), get in and ride (Yeah, yeah)

But I keep the stick and I'm firin' (Bitch)

Got so many vibes stuffed in the car
We can fuck them hoes six at a time (No cap)
I make them hoes say, "That nigga so fine" (Ooh)
"Girl, he got the dick you can feel in your spine" (Yeah)
Yeah, that what they say about Baby
You know that them bitches don't play about Baby
Baby should go run for president
Look what God did, took his time with me (Yeah, yeah)
Got a red and white ho like a peppermint (Ooh)
Book the hotel, take the vibes in
She gon' fuck me and fuck on my brethren (Uh)

I ain't finished yet (Mmh), get another bitch (Mmh)
Got her ridin' dick and screamin', "Yeehaw" (Mmh, mmh, mmh, mmh)

TOES Lyrics
My heart so cold I think I'm done with ice (Uh, brr)
'Cause I bring guns to fights (Boom)
Say you got that sack, I got that sack
But ain't no ones in mine (Nope)
And my lil' bitch say I'm gettin' too bougie
I don't even like dubs in mine (Alright)
What I look like with all them twenties? (Huh?)
Know them hoes like how I'm coming (Yeah)
What I look like with all this money? (Huh?)
How I look havin' all these hoes? (Uh)
When I crack a smile, white gold (Bling)
Yeah, I'm talkin' diamonds, froze (Yeah)
Came from the bottom, toes (Woah, Kenny)
Yeah, backend Baby (A hundred)
That's what they pay me a show (Let's go)
That's probably some cap in my rap
By the time this shit drop, they gon' pay me some more (Uh-huh)
And I still can go back to the trap
Send a box, pick it up, make a play at the store
Feelings still hurt from when I saved that ho
My heart so cold I think I'm done with ice (Uh, brr)
Said if I leave her, she gon' die
Well, bitch, you done with life (Okay)
Better not pull up with no knife
'Cause I bring guns to fights (Boom)
Say you got that sack, I got that sack
But ain't no ones in mine (Nope)
And my lil' bitch say I'm gettin' too bougie
I don't even like dubs in mine (Alright)
Nope
Too raw, dope (Yeah)
You know I'm one of the G.O.A.T.'s
She let me put it in the back of her throat
Walk in the bank with a M in a tote (Yeah)
I'm tryna make a deposit
Let 'em try play with the money (Pow, pow)
Shawty gon' take off your noggin
Long as she want it and pick it, I'm buyin' it
I had the Rover for a year, I don't drive
I get 'em whacked, I don't advise 'em to try it, yeah
I'm runnin' shit, I ain't lyin'
I got a backend for one twenty-five
I bought a Patek for one eighty-five
This shit gettin' easy at this point
My heart so cold I think I'm done with ice (Uh, brr)
Said if I leave her, she gon' die
Well, bitch, you done with life (Okay)
Better not pull up with no knife
'Cause I bring guns to fights (Boom)
Say you got that sack, I got that sack
But ain't no ones in mine (Nope)
And my lil' bitch say I'm gettin' too bougie
I don't even like dubs in mine (Alright)
Heartless, don't need a valentine (Forever)
I call 'em racks, not bands (Why?)
Ain't no rubber band on mine (At all)
I used to be down, down, down, down
Waiting on taxes time (Fucked up)
Look at me now, now, now, now
They pay me to flex and shine (I'm up, let's get it)
Big speaker like an eighteen inch sub (Yeah)
I'm a hundred, you a dub (Nothin')
Lookin' for me, I'm booked up (Where you at?)
50 Cent, I'm in the club (Hey)
Diamonds on my earlobe, ice on dyke (Huh?)
One-fifty on studs
Rugrat, young nigga got it out the mud
My heart so cold I think I'm done with ice (Uh, brr, Big Bagg)
Said if I leave her, she gon' die
Well, bitch, you done with life (Okay)
Better not pull up with no knife
'Cause I bring guns to fights (Boom)
Say you got that sack, I got that sack
But ain't no ones in mine (Nope)
And my lil' bitch say I'm gettin' too bougie

When I talk it, I live it, they feel it (Hah)
And I got a pretty bitch with a fat ass
Put one leg in the air when I hit it (Ha-ha-ha-ha, Firzt on the track)
The police behind me, you know that I'm smashing
I ain't pulling over, you tripping (Vroom, vroom)
But I ain't tryna talk about police
Let's talk 'bout bitches, let's talk 'bout business (Okay)
Let's talk 'bout this young nigga that came up from nothing
Now he worth a motherfuckin' million (M)
Used to pay for a section, now they gotta bring us the backend to come in the building (Hah)
I knew that I was special back when we was breaking in houses and robbin' and stealin' (Okay)
We made you put your hands in the air, put that thang in your face, run your pockets, we dippin' (Hah)
And I ain't gotta act like I'm 'bout it, ain't ask for no vouchers, I'm really official (Okay)
Tryna look out for karma, I had good intentions, I'm still asking God to forgive me (Turn up)
I know I got these fuck niggas pissed off, I'm over they bitch house, I'm all on the WiFi
I'ma trick 'em and play Mr. Nice Guy (Hah)
When he front, I run off, nigga, bye-bye
I tell her I'm a motherfuckin' star
She can see me on TV, just turn it on Syfy
You know that I got a whole lot of hoes, and they all different colors, I mix 'em like tie-dye (Yeah)
We gon' make your ho dance with the devil, it's October 7th, shout out my boy DaDa (Ha)
Turn it up on a whole 'nother level, now they can't deny it, I'm catching they eye now (They eye)
You might not wanna run up on me to promote your CD 'less you ready to die now (Boom)
I can lower the price on the P's and you get 'em from me if you buy more than five now, bitch
And I'm the best motherfuckin' rapper, man, you know like
Th-that's just too much for 'em, like
You know it's just too much for 'em, First
You see what I'm saying, it's just too much for 'em, man
You know, it's too much for 'em
Blank Blank, you know
The best motherfuckin' rapper
The prettiest chocolate nigga alive

SethInTheKitchen

Told my bitch "I love you", that was just a typo
That bitch drive me crazy (Uh), she gon' make me psycho (Yeah)
Everything I been through (Yeah), it's something only I know

Ayy, I'm a legend just like Michael
My bitch is ungrateful, so I'm out with my side ho
She gon' treat me different, I should make her my ho
She don't need no surgery, she don't got no lipo
But she got that ass, though, told her how to throw it right
She treat me like a motorcycle, ride me like a motorbike, vroom
I just took off, check the speed (Yeah)
I just made 100K off a show (Show)
I just made 50K off of weed (Yeah)
You know I like to play with your ho (Huh)
I choke her and pull out her weave (Huh)
I told her "Bae, I gotta go" (Go)
She beggin' me "Stay over, please" (Please)
I gotta leave, boo (Ayy)
I don't wanna mislead you (Uh)

'Cause to be honest I put my side nigga above him
Tell him that I know that he creepin' with that ho
That's why I'm fuckin' that nigga that I be callin' my bro (Bro, bro)
Middle finger, fuck a-you
Who the fuck is you?
This L is for you, I'ma take a W
Fuck on the dick, then I fuck up a check
He say he want a kiss, but I give him a peck
I said "Call me Aretha," I want my respect
When you niggas get stupid, it's plenty on deck
Ain't about to be sittin' home cryin' for you
Better get one in pink if you buy it in blue
All these niggas is lined up eyein' the coupe
Because takin' your spot what they dyin' to do
Ayo, open the door, give me my clothes
Throw me the keys, 'cause I'm taking the Rolls'
Get any closer, we comin' to blows
You get the picture, ain't talkin' a pose

Why you ruin it, ruin it?

Beatbox Freestyle Lyrics
Best motherfuckin' rapper, nigga
This Baby, nigga, let's go
Ready to get it started, nigga (Go)
Whenever you want it
I was the man with the plan since a shawty
Pull up to the Grammy Awards with my .40 (Damn E, this shit exclusive)
She told me she like how I'm dressin' and I ain't eatin' no salad (Uh-huh)
Stevie Wonder can see that I'm havin'
I told her, "Be patient," she waited
I gave her the dick, she walked out doin' the "Beat Box Challenge"
Like yeah, get in thеre, baby (Get in therе)
You know me, hit you anywhere, baby (Let's go)
Know she gon' do whatever I say
I could piss in a cup, call it lemonade, baby
Let that bitch off, I'm a renegade, baby
I'ma get outta there, I ain't feelin' that (Huh?)
Nigga run up on me with a cellphone out
He gon' fuck around, die on the internet (Doo-doo-doo-doo)
Fuck it, kill him on IG Live
Let the whole world see the nigga die (Die)
Yeah, shout-out to SpotEm', we got 'em (Get down)
Even though he a rapper, he shot him
I get this big pretty-ass smile from my mama (Cheese)
Get this motherfuckin' voice from my daddy
I learned how to pimp on them hoes from my uncle (Pimp, pimp)
Let her suck on my toes 'cause I'm nasty (Okay)
Like fuck it, she asked me to do it
Play with me, I'ma actually shoot you
Most of these niggas be cap and we knew it
These niggas drop shit and we laugh at they music
I know how to murder these niggas with kindness
Fuckin' they bitch from the back, how I do it
I buy a Cuban and fill it with diamonds
Send my assistant to pick up some condoms
Instagram model at the hotel textin' me now
Want me to give her the Johnson
Damn, that nigga Baby on fire and it won't go out
They know that lil' nigga's a problem
Got a big .45 on decock (Go)
Usin' big words like I'm T.I. (Turn up)
Don't wanna get me started, nigga
Turn me up, niggas gon' see why
Nigga, you a bitch, JoJo Siwa (Bitch)
You let the wrong nigga get rich
Both of these chains on my neck, they compete with each other
They fightin' and throwin' a fit
Know how these hoes like to argue and beef with each other
She fightin' now, over the dick
You should already know you ain't searchin' DaBaby
'Cause that nigga like to come in with the stick
I don't like to get into the mix (No)
I done got paid in full, my nigga
I get them hoes like I'm Mitch
Even got white people all on my dick (Go)
Yeah, second year, six-time Grammy-nominated
Came through turnt up, everybody hated
Before I had my first M, it was Billion Dollar Baby
He bet the house and his self like Las Vegas (Go)
You want the shit? Gotta earn it
He off the leash, he don't think he can get murdered
Know how to swim, so I fuck with who fuckin' with me
I take a bridge and I burn it
Let me see if you can swim, lil' nigga
Shit gettin' out of hand, I just parked a new Benz
Hopped in a new Benz, lil' nigga (Let's go)
And Ion't want new friends
(That ain't DaBaby, that's my baby)
Yeah, yeah, they say they want that old shit back, you know (Said that, make that, stand on that)
I told 'em, don't get me started, nigga
They say they want that Baby Jesus, put me in that mode (Yeah, get that Baby Jesus)
You know, I'm tryna enjoy this bread (Go)
You know, be fancy and shit, be mainstream and shit, you know, you know? (Fasho)
They said I went commercial, like I still won't come up off the hip and hurt you
Bitch ass nigga
Aight, man, it's 6:55 in the mornin', man, shit21Embed
ROCKSTAR (BLM Remix) Lyrics
Even if I told you, still wouldn't understand what happened
Number one on the charts, I'm there vicariously
Oh, there they go
Biasedly pushin' negative narratives, I'm ready, though
Cops wanna pull me over, embarrass me
Abusin' power, you never knew me, thought I was arrogant
As a juvenile, police pulled their guns like they scared of me
And we're used to how crackers treat us, now that's the scary thing
Want anything we good at and we cherish it
Now we all fed up and niggas comin' back for everything
Rockstars, nigga, just watch the news, they burnin' cop cars, nigga
Kill another nigga, break the law, then call us outlaws, nigga
What happened? Want us to keep it peaceful
Shoulda seen them hatin' bitches face when I bought that Lamborghini (SethInTheKitchen)
Throw up my middle finger, police can't catch me, this a
Brand new Lamborghini, fuck a cop car
With the pistol on my hip like I'm a cop (Yeah, yeah, yeah)
Have you ever met a real nigga rockstar? (Yeah)
This ain't no guitar, bitch, this a Glock (Woo)
My Glock told me to promise you gon' squeeze me (Woo)
You better let me go the day you need me (Woo)
Soon as you up me on that nigga, get to bustin' (Woo)
And if I ain't enough, go get the chop
It's safe to say I earned it, ain't a nigga gave me nothin' (Yeah, yeah, yeah)
I'm ready to hop out on a nigga, get to bustin'
Know you heard me say, "You play, you lay," don't make me push the button
Full of pain, dropped enough tears to fill up a fuckin' bucket
Goin' for buckets, I bought a chopper
I got a big drum, it hold a hundred, ain't goin' for nothin'
I'm ready to air it out on all these niggas, I can see 'em runnin'
Just talked to my mama, she hit me on FaceTime just to check up on me and my brother
I'm really the baby, she know that her youngest son was always guaranteed to get the money (Okay, let's go)
She know that her baby boy was always guaranteed to get the loot
She know what I do, she know 'fore I run from a nigga, I'ma pull it out and shoot (Boom)
PTSD, I'm always waking up in cold sweats like I got the flu
My daughter a G, she saw me kill a nigga in front of her before the age of two
And I'll kill another nigga too
'Fore I let another nigga do somethin' to you
Long as you know that, don't let nobody tell you different
Daddy love you (Yeah, yeah)
Let's go
Brand new Lamborghini, fuck a cop car
With the pistol on my hip like I'm a cop (Yeah, yeah, yeah)
Have you ever met a real nigga rockstar? (Yeah)
This ain't no guitar, bitch, this a Glock (Woo)
My Glock told me to promise you gon' squeeze me (Woo)
You better let me go the day you need me (Woo)
Soon as you up me on that nigga, get to bustin' (Woo, yeah)
And if I ain't enough, go get the chop (Yeah, yeah)
Keep a Glocky when I ride in the Suburban
'Cause the codeine had a young nigga swervin'
I got the mop, watch me wash 'em like detergent
And I'm ballin', that's why it's diamonds on my jersey
Slide on opps' side and flip the block back, yeah, yeah
My junior popped him and left him lopsided, yeah, yeah
We spin his block, got the rebound, Dennis Rodman
Fool me one time, you can't cross me again
Twelve hundred horsepower, I get lost in the wind
If he talkin' on the yard, the pen' dogs'll take his chin
Maybach SUV for my refugees
Buy blocks in the hood, put money in the streets
I was solo when the opps caught me at the gas station
Had it on me, thirty thousand, thought it was my last day
But they ain't even want no smoke
If I had to choose it, murder what she wrote
Let's go
Brand new Lamborghini, fuck a cop car
With the pistol on my hip like I'm a cop (Yeah, yeah, yeah)
Have you ever met a real nigga rockstar? (Yeah)
This ain't no guitar, bitch, this a Glock (Woo)
My Glock told me to promise you gon' squeeze me (Woo)
You better let me go the day you need me (Woo)
Soon as you up me on that nigga, get to bustin' (Woo)
And if I ain't enough, go get the chop16Embed

Okay, let's go, nigga
(Rocco did it again)
Wait a minute, who are you? (Ayy, yo, K.i.D.)
And I'll make my bitch talk to me when we fuckin' (Talk back)
Big rocks on my wrist, I bust it (Bling)
Big Glock on my hip, I'm clutchin' (Let's go)
Get lost on a bitch, ain't nothin'
She say I look good, bitch, I been doin' pushups
Play with Baby and Top, nigga, good luck
My lil' daughter two, but got six figures put up
Knock his head off his neck 'fore he look up
Ten toes in they chest for a check, bitch, I stood up (What that mean?)
I stood up on they neck for a check (Uh-huh)
Now my head get 'em stressed, I'm a vet
I get 300K for a show, bitch, I'm blessed
Go to trippin' and buckin', them hoes get down
I spray it, I don't go no handles (Bah, baow)
We be pullin' up back to back, play, we gon' handle that
I'ma walk in with Three and Montana
Go to buckin', won't wait for to touch him
He start it, you know he gon' get his shit canceled (Cancel his ass)
Put that stick to your face, screamin' out 4KTrey
From the north of Baton Rouge to Atlanta
Talk out his top, put them bands on him, bitch (The fuck?)
I be runnin' my city, the police don't like it
They know we be steppin' on shit (Steppin' on shit)
Put that blick on your brother, you feelin' some way
Make him hot, tell him dig up the bitch (Dig up the bitch)
Shoot two hundred, bet one, how you livin', lil' nigga?
You know I be havin' this shit (Stupid lil' nigga)
Paranoid every day, I be feelin' some way
When you bring up the static and shit
Switch the channel, we fixin' that static (Let's switch)
Give a nigga a clip, he can have it
Get to hittin' so quick, they think it's automatic (Boom, boom, let's go)
Nigga gon' try to hide in the house
Get his ass to come out, hit his bitch ass in traffic (Like boom)
Made a song in ten minutes, went platinum
Know we still with the shits, send a hit, we get active (Yeah)
Mention YB and Baby, the game in the padlock (Yeah)
My lil' bitch got that ass with no waist, pretty face
A six-pack, niggas think she got ass shots
I hit her from the back 'til we pass out (Uh-huh)
I Kurt Angle that ho, put her leg in the air, ankle lock
Hold that bitch 'til she tap out (Bitch)
Be one deep on your street with that strap out (One deep)
Fuck a rapper, let's see what that rack 'bout
Got a brand new pistol, nigga
I make it jump like, like crack in the '80s
Baby, these bitch ass niggas ain't crazy
Broke ass, ASCAP go straight to my baby
(Hold on, Lil Top, talk to 'em, nigga)
And I'll make my bitch talk to me when we fuckin' (Talk back)
Big rocks on my wrist, I bust it (Bling)
Big Glock on my hip, I'm clutchin' (Let's go)
Get lost on a bitch, ain't nothin'
Mic check, one-two, check one, stretch two
When it come to murder, you know how we do
When I walk in this bitch, keep your hands to yourself
It go down, shoot it up, spin again in a coupe (Bang, bang)
When you come to my house, you see everything new
You probably'll find a strap in every room
I went bought me a Rollie on top of this Patek
But, bitch, it ain't on, I'ma jump out with two
Shorty say she on me, yeah
We be on her ass soon as I walk in the room
Nigga don't know me, yeah, we be on his ass
Stalk him all through the day to the moon
Street nigga, I don't never pick and choose
I be totin' on somethin' make all them bitch niggas move (Pussy)
Soon as we run down, we gon' dirt him
You know it ain't certain, we never be leavin' no clues, nigga
Hold on, I'm Lil Top, nigga, believe that
I make it jump like, like crack in the '80s
Baby, these bitch ass niggas ain't crazy
Broke ass, ASCAP go straight to my baby
(Hold on, Lil Top, talk to 'em, nigga)
And I'll make my bitch talk to me when we fuckin' (Talk back)
Big rocks on my wrist, I bust it (Bling)
Big Glock on my hip, I'm clutchin' (Let's go)
Get lost on a bitch, ain't nothin'
I make it jump like I'm Giannis (Just honest)
Tryna see how it feel from behind her (Let's go)
Know that lil' bitch ain't shit, don't deserve to suck dick
Make that bitch give me head with a condom (Uh-huh)
Wanna gamble and crap out, let's get it
We put racks on his motherfuckin' cap like a fitted (No cap)
Baby pull up 2020, hop out like it's nothin'
That lil' nigga stuntin', he shittin' (Vroom)
I get high by myself in the skybox (Yeah)
I came out the house, two F&N's for the day (Two)
Why you bring 'em both out? Nigga, why not? (Why?)
Let 'em go like a pro, let 'em try now (Let's try)

Pick my boo up from school and we sign out (Mwah)

Broke ass, ASCAP go straight to my baby

FIND MY WAY Lyrics
Wait a minute, who are you? (Ayy, yo, K.i.D)
But when it's up and then go down, they treat me like the villain
Guess I forgot to mention
I'm just a nigga with a broken heart tryna find my way back home
And I'm sittin' here with the car in park while she ride dick to my song
Ooh, I know the feelin', ain't it? (Okay)
You ever feel the way I feel, you know it feel amazin' (Let's go)
I had this bitch, we used to kick it, she was feelin' Baby (Mwah, mwah, mwah)
She stepped on my heart, had me feelin' basic (Damn)
You know how people like to come back when you level up (Uh-huh)
I made a change, you stayed the same, I got ahead of ya
Plus I been tryin' to free some time up in my schedule, but (Uh-huh)
When opportunity knockin', I never say no
'Cause I been busy catchin' them blessings I used to pray for (Let's go)
Stackin' up the backend like Tetris, we playin' Legos
And every day I pray to God that a nigga don't try to play, though
'Cause I don't like to play, be done gave a nigga a halo (Boom, boom, boom)
Thinkin' 'bout the people I lost, know I got some angels
Chillin' with my freak, when we fuckin', it ease my anger
I'm takin' selfies with my bitch, she keep switchin' up different angles
And no, I never kept a bitch, but I always keep me a banger (Boom, boom, boom)
I keep it loaded when I ride 'cause I'm still a nigga (Ah)
I fuck with her to ease my mind, 'cause I be in my feelings
And every single person in my life tell me I'm their hero
But when it's up and then go down, they treat me like the villain
Guess I forgot to mention
I'm just a nigga with a broken heart tryna find my way back home
And I'm sittin' here with the car in park while she ride dick to my song
Ooh, I let her ride again
She spread her legs and open up, I end up slidin' in (Okay)
She know the shit excitin' you is not excitin' him (Me)
She swallow me up every mornin' like a vitamin (Yup)
He know to come look where I'm at, he wanna find her, shit (She with me)
Know I'm aggressive, when she kiss me, like to bite her lip (Grr)
I don't be makin' love songs, they don't excite a jit (No)
Real nigga, I got feelings, I'm not hiding it (Yeah, okay, let's go)
Still pimpin', tell the bitch I really like her friend (Yeah, bitch)
You know her pussy good 'cause I be tryna fly her in (Yeah, bitch)
If I speak once, she don't respond, I won't say hi again (Bitch)
She catch me once and let me slide, I never lie again (Let's go)
My name not Melly, I got murder on my mind again (Uh-huh)
I'm with the shits, I'd kill him twice if he could die again
And if he think 'bout tryin' me, he better try again
'Cause I'ma let 'em spin, if he don't drop, then we gon' slide again (Doo-doo-doo-doo)
I keep it loaded when I ride 'cause I'm still a nigga (Ah)
I fuck with her to ease my mind, 'cause I be in my feelings
And every single person in my life tell me I'm their hero
But when it's up and then go down, they treat me like the villain
Guess I forgot to mention
I'm just a nigga with a broken heart tryna find my way back home
And I'm sittin' here with the car in park while she ride dick to my song (Bitch)32Embed
Today (Intro) Lyrics
Ah, bitch (Hahaha, yeah, Baby Talk 5)
Fuck a nigga mean, nigga? (Baby Talk 5)
Fuck you talkin' 'bout? (Yeah, yeah, yeah)
I'm on they ass today, I just went and picked me up a bag today
I pulled up on the scene with a bad lil' bae (Ooh)
She got a fat ass, when I smash, it shake (Ooh)
Smackin' her ass, playin' patty cake (Ah)
Shut the fuck up, do what daddy say
I think I got lil' baby mad at me (Huh?)
Fucked up her hair, she look bad today
Told her, "Hop in the whip, we can go get it fixed"
I'ma drop the bitch off with my sis, she the shit
As soon as she done with that nappy ass hair, you can call up your boy to come pick up his bitch (Brrt, damn)
Look at my wrist, that's a brick, I just fucked up my Rolex, but fuck it, it's lit (Damn)
I don't give a fuck 'bout no fame or no chain, ain't no jewelry, put me on the lick (Damn)
I just went sat with the label (Huh?)
Niggas offered me a contract (What happened?)
Told them niggas, "I ain't want it" (Why?)
The shit was wack, I didn't sign that (Uh)
I'm the best, but never mind that (Okay)
My shit so hard that they rewind that (Ah)
Got that work if you can't find that (Huh?)
You can't afford it, we can finance
I got one foot in the trap, got one foot up they ass, ditch your coat on the rap
Got my dick in your bitch, she be bendin' it over and bustin' it open and throwin' it back
I'm tryna go fuck her buddy
Fuck all these hoes, 'cause they don't really love me
I'm tryna get me some motherfuckin' money
If they free Meek Mill, why they ain't free my cousin?
I bet we shoot up your motherfuckin' party if somebody touch me or one of my brothers
I bet won't none of these niggas that talk on the internet try me, they see me in public
I bet they play all my motherfuckin' teachin'
Bitch, I don't rap, I be motherfuckin' preachin'
I bet you paid for that motherfuckin' show and I bet you paid for that motherfuckin' feature (Bitch)
I'm on they ass today, I just went and picked me up a bag today
I pulled up on the scene with a bad lil' bae (Huh? Huh?)
She got a fat ass, when I smash, it shake
Smackin' her ass, playin' patty cake
Shut the fuck up, do what daddy say
I think I got lil' baby mad at me
Fuck it, let's go to the bank
I'm 'bout to motherfuckin' blank (Blank, blank, blank)
My name hold weight, I got motherfuckin' rank
I'm in the rental with my brother Thank
We tryna eat, where our motherfuckin' plate? (Ha)
It's been there with me, y'all just motherfuckin' late
I need that shit now, I can't motherfuckin' wait
I bet you act like you motherfuckin' know
I put this .45 on your motherfuckin' face, bitch
I'm on they ass today, I just went and picked me up a bag today (Huh? Huh?)
I pulled up on the scene with a bad lil' bae (Skrrt)
She got a fat ass, when I smash, it shake (Uh-huh)
Smackin' her ass, playin' patty cake
Shut the fuck up, do what daddy say
I think I got lil' baby mad at me
