# dababy-bot

dababy-bot is a Discord bot based on hit artist DaBaby designed for small community servers. It features role management, YouTube radio, hand-made server events, various bot interactions, and more!

## Features
Dababy can do a lot of things! Some major features include:
### Interaction
  - **Messaging:** Talk with Dababy and he'll say random lines from his songs. Or use a persona to impersonate another server member!
  - **Stats:** Quickly get information about a user or role.
  - **Server Events:** Personally designed server events that can be enabled or disabled in a breeze.
  - **Interaction:** Interact with the bot in other ways, such as rock-paper-scissors or randomly selecting someone as "sus." à¶ž
### Role Management
  - **Roles:** Users can manually add or remove cosmetic roles such as video-game-specific ones.
  - **Jail:** Admins can send users to Brazil if they misbehave and the bot will keep track of them automatically.
### Online Services
  - **YouTube Radio:** The bot offers basic music functionality for voice channels.

## Server Invitation
This bot is designed for small-scale use, so there is no invite link.
