# dababy-bot

dababy-bot is a Discord bot based on hit artist DaBaby designed for small community servers. It features role management, YouTube radio, server events, various bot interactions, and more!

This is a small passion project by John Gionti as an introduction to the Python language.

## Feature Overview
Dababy can do a lot of things! Some major features include:
### Interaction
  - **Messaging:** Talk with Dababy and he'll say random lines from his songs. Or use a persona to impersonate another server member!
  - **Stats:** Quickly get information about a user or role.
  - **Server Events:** Personally designed server events that can be enabled or disabled in a breeze.
  - **Interaction:** Interact with the bot in other ways, such as rock-paper-scissors or randomly selecting someone as "sus."
### Role Management
  - **Roles:** Users can manually add or remove cosmetic roles such as video-game-specific ones.
  - **Jail:** Admins can send users to Brazil if they misbehave and the bot will keep track of them automatically.
### Online Services
  - **YouTube Radio:** As music bots are being shut down by YouTube, the bot offers basic music functionality for voice channels.

## Server Invitation
There are currently no plans to release this bot to the public.
